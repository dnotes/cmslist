    "summary": "Jekyll is a static site generator written in Ruby that transforms plain text files into static websites and blogs. It uses Markdown for content creation and Liquid templating for layouts. As a static site generator, it doesn't require a database, and the generated sites can be hosted on various platforms, including GitHub Pages. While it doesn't provide built-in APIs, its simplicity and flexibility make it a popular choice for developers seeking a straightforward solution for static site creation."
